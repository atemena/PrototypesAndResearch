I really like the last 8 photos I got approved. I want to add them to a gallery widget and publish as fast as possible.

I'm running a halloween campaign. I do not have a gallery/collection/animal from last years, but I know I have photos that I can use. I want to add all these related photos to a collection that I can come back to when I need content.
